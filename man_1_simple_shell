.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 2019-11-26 GNU SIMPLE SHELL "Simple Shell Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
.B simple_shell
- UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Usage: simple_shell
.PP
.B [command] [argument[1]] [argument[2]]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
The simple_shell program is a UNIX command line interpreter that will display a prompt and waits for the user to input a command, which will always end with a new line.
The prompt will be displayed each time a command has been executed, though if an executable is not found, an error message will be displayed before the prompt reappears.
.PP
.B Return Value
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
The shell can be paired with the following options:
-c string
Commands are read from string.
-i
Act as if shell had been invoked as a login shell
-r
The shell becomes restricted
-s
Commands are read from the standard input
-D
Printed list of double-quoted strings followed by $
--
A -- signals the end of options
.PP
.SH ARGUMENTS
If no option is supplied, the shell reads and exicutes, then exits
.PP
.SH INVOCATION
A login shell is where the first character of argument zero is a - or 1 started with --login option.
An interactive shell is started without non option arguments
.PP
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
.SH DEFINITIONS
blank - A space or tab
word - A sequence of characters considered single unit
name - A word consisting of alphanumeric characters and underscores
metacharacter - A character that unquoted separates words
control operator - A token that can perform a control function
.PP
.SH RESERVED WORDS
Reserved words are words with a special meaning to the shell.
.PP
.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.PP
.SH	SIMPLE COMMANDS
A simple command is a sequence of variable assignments followed by blank spaces and terminated by a control operator.
.PP
.SH	PIPLINES
A pipeline is a series of commands seperated by | or |&
.PP
.SH	LISTS
A group of pipeline sequences seperated by operators ;, &, && and iptionally terminated by ;, & or <newline>.
.PP
.SH	COMPOUND COMMANDS
Compound commands can be executed in a subshell environment. Return status is exit status of list.
.PP
.SH	COPROCESSES
A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell as if the command had been terminated, with a two way pipe between the executing shell and coprocess.
.PP
.SH	SHELL FUNCTION DEFINITIONS
An object called like a simple command and executes a command with new positional parameters.
		function - defines name
		Compound Commands - commands called on by name
.PP
.SH COMMENTS
When a # is used, all remaining characters on that line are ignored. An interactive shell without interactive_comments does not allow comments without option enabled.
.PP
.SH QUOTING
This is used to remove special meaning of certain special characters to the shell. There are three quoting options:
- a non quoted backslash (\)
- single quotes to preserve literal value
- double quotes to preserve literal value except $, `, \, and !.
.PP
.SH PARAMETERS
An entity that stores values such as a name, number or one of the special characters listed under SPECIAL PARAMETERS. A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.
.PP
.SH	POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
A positional parameter is denoted by one or more digits other than 0. They are assigned form shell's arguments and may be reassigned using the set command.
.PP
.SH	SPECIAL PARAMETERS
These can only be referenced, not assigned.
* - expands to the positional parameters, starting from one and expand expands singly
@ - expands to the positional parameters, starting from one and expand expands to single words
# - expands number of positional parameters in decimal
? - expands to exit status of most recently executed pipeline
- - expands to current option flags specified on invocationby the set builtin command
$ - expands to process ID of the shell
! - expands to process ID of the mose recent executed background command
0 - expands to name of shell
_ - set to absolute pathname used to invoke shell script being used as passed in the environment or argument list
.PP
.SH	SHELL VARIABLES
Variables set by the shell
BASH - expands to full file name used to invoke this instance
For a complete list, see SHELL VARIABLES
.PP
.SH ARRAYS
One dimensional indexing. There is no maximum limit on size and no requirement of indexing or contiguous assignment.
.PP
.SH EXPANSION
Performed on the command line after being parsed into words.
.PP
.SH	BRACE EXPANSION
A mechanism by which arbitrary strings can be generated
.PP
.SH	TILDE EXPANSION
A tilde-prefix treats following characters as a possible login name
.PP
.SH	PARAMETER AND VARIABLE EXPANSION
The '$' character promotes parameter expansion, command substitution or arithmetic expansion.
.PP
.SH	COMMAND SUBSTITUTION
Allows command output to replace command name
.PP
.SH	ARITHMETIC EXPANSION
Allows the evaluation of possible arithmetic and the substitution of the result
.PP
.SH	PROCESS SUBSTITUTION
Supported on systems that support named pipes or the /dev/fd method of naming open files
.PP
.SH	WORD SPLITTIN
Parses through result, marking the sequences of <space> <tab> and <newline> while "" or '' are retained. If no expansion occurs, bo splitting occurs.
.PP
.SH	PATHNAME EXPANSION
Scans each word for *, ?, and [. If one appears, the word is regarded as a pattern and replaced with the corresponding file name.
.PP
.SH   PATTERN MATCHING
Any character appearing in a pattern not described below matches itself. NULL may not occur in a pattern.
* - matches any string, including null string
? - matches any single character
[...] - matches any enclosed characters
*() - matches zero or one occurence
+() - matches zero or more occurence
@() - matches one or more occurence
!() - matches one of given patterns
.PP
.SH   QUOTE REMOVAL
All unquoted instances of \, single and double quotes that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.
.PP
.SH REDIRECTION
Changing input or output of an executing command
.PP
.SH ALIASES
Allow strings to be substituted for a word when it is used as first word of simple command. The characters /, $, `, and = cannot appear in alias names. To remove the alias, use unalias.
.PP
.SH FUNCTIONS
Defined under SHELL GRAMMAR, a function is a series of commands stored for later execution.
.PP
.SH ARITHMETIC EVALUATION
Evaluation can be done in fixed width integers with no check for overflow. Division by 0 is flagged as an error.
.PP
.SH CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS
Used by the [[ compound command and the test and [ built in commands, this tests file attributes and performs string and arithmetic comparisons. Primaries on files follow symbolic links and operate on target of the link.
.PP
.SH SIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION
    1. Words marked as variable assignments and redirections are saved for later processing.
    2. Words not saved are expanded
    3. Redirections are performed
    4. Text after the = in variable assignment undergoes expansion, substitution and quote removal before being assigned
.PP
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
Functions and the PATH are parsed for the results of the shell command and optional arguments.
.PP
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT
The shell has an execution environment that can be manipulated by shell commands and â€¢ format.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT

.PP
.SH SIGNALS
Helps with inherited values and checks for traps and non builtin commands run by signal handlers
.PP
.SH JOB CONTROL
The ability to selectively stop, or suspend any execution of processes and continue, or resume their execution at a later point.
.PP
.SH PROMPTING
When interactive, shell displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command and secondary PS2 when more input is needed to complete a command.

.PP
.SH	READLINE VARIABLES
Variables that can be used to further customize its behavion.

.PP
.SH	SEARCHING

A list of commands previously typed. This command history can be manipulated using the appropriate variables.
.PP

This introduces words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert arguments or fix errors in previous commands. This relates with event designators, word designators and modifiers.
